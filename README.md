# CLA — ME 396P Nav2 Demo

This demo runs the **TurtleBot3 Navigation2** stack in simulation using **Docker** and **tmux automation scripts**.  
The workflow is designed to run entirely within one container session — you enter the container once, perform SLAM to create a map, then run Navigation2 using that saved map. You can then run Nav2 with a custom python script for and automated survey demo.

---

## Pre-Requisites

### Docker Setup
Install **Docker** and **Docker Compose** on your host system:  
[https://www.docker.com/get-started/](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)

Verify installation:
```bash
docker --version
docker compose version
```

### Environment Requirements
- Host: X11 display enabled (default on most desktops)
- GPU acceleration is optional; CPU simulation is sufficient for this demo.

---

## Getting Started

### GUI Permission (on host)
Allow Docker containers to display graphical windows (Gazebo and RViz):
```bash
xhost +local:root
```

### Build the Docker Image (on host)
From the project root directory (where your Dockerfile and `docker-compose.yml` are located):
```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

This builds the container image and installs:
- ROS 2 Humble
- TurtleBot3 Simulation Packages
- Navigation2 (Nav2)
- Cartographer SLAM
- tmux + automation scripts

### Enter the Container
Once the container is running:

```bash
docker exec -it nav2-demo bash
```

You should now see something like:
```
root@<container_id>:/workspace/src#
```

You are now inside the container’s shell environment, starting in the **`workspace/src`** directory.

All subsequent steps take place **inside this container**.

To leave the container at any time, simply type:
```bash
exit
```

This will return you to your host machine’s terminal.

## Stage 1 — SLAM (Cartographer)

### Launch SLAM
Inside the container:
```bash
bash /root/scripts/slam_tmux.sh
```
This starts a tmux session that automatically launches:
- Gazebo simulation
- Cartographer (SLAM) + RViz
- Teleop control
- Map saver utility

### Tab Layout (Shown at Bottom of Terminal)

| Tab | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| [0] | **guide** | Instructions + quit control (`q`) |
| [1] | **gazebo** | Gazebo launch |
| [2] | **slam** | Cartographer (SLAM) + RViz launch|
| [3] | **teleop** | Keyboard control (must be active tab to drive) |
| [4] | **map_saver** | Press **Enter** anytime to save map |

### Navigating Between Tabs
Click the tab name at bottom of the terminal **OR** use the **Alt + #** shortcuts:
- **Alt + 0** → guide
- **Alt + 1** → gazebo  
- **Alt + 2** → slam  
- **Alt + 3** → teleop  
- **Alt + 4** → map_saver  

### Operating SLAM

1. Start in **[0] guide** to review instructions.
2. Wait for **Gazebo** and **RViz** to pop-up.
3. Switch to **[3] teleop**.
4. Before driving:
   - Be able to see **[3] teleop** terminal, **RViz**, and **Gazebo**.
   - Align the starting **RViz** map with **Gazebo** to the best of your ability.
   - Suggested Single Monitor Layout:

       ![SLAM Setup Example](Images/SLAM_Setup_Example.png)
4. How to drive:
   - Be selected into **[3] teleop** terminal.
   - Use **W/A/S/D/X** keys to control the robots linear and angular velocities.
   - \**Controlling velocities to navigate can feel weird at first, remember you can always stop with* **S**.
5. As you move the robot:
   - **Gazebo** shows the simulated robot moving in the environment.
   - **RViz** Displays the occupancy grid map updating in real time
      - Walls and obstacles appear as **black lines**.
      - Unexplored regions are **gray**.
      - Free space is **white**.
6. When the occupancy map appears complete:  
   - Example of a completed map:

       ![Occupancy Map Example](Images/Occupancy_Map_Example.png)
   - Switch to **[4] map_saver**.  
   - Press **Enter** to save the map to:  
     ```
     /root/data/my_map.yaml
     ```
7. Once finished, return to **[0] guide** and enter `q` to quit the session.  
   This stops all processes and returns you to the container shell.

## Stage 2 — Navigation (Using Saved Map)

After completing SLAM and saving the map, you can launch the Navigation2 stack.

### Launch Navigation2
Inside the same container session:
```bash
bash /root/scripts/nav_tmux.sh
```
This starts a tmux session that launches:
- Gazebo simulation
- Nav2 + RViz

### Tab Layout (Shown at Bottom of Terminal)

| Tab | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| [0] | **guide** | Instructions + quit control (`q`) |
| [1] | **gazebo** | Gazebo launch|
| [2] | **nav2** | Nav2 + RViz launch |

### Navigating Between Tabs

Use the **Alt + number** shortcuts:
- **Alt + 0** → guide  
- **Alt + 1** → gazebo  
- **Alt + 2** → nav2  

### Operating Nav2

1. Start in **[0] guide** to review instructions.
2. Wait for **Gazebo** and **RViz** to pop-up.  
   - **RViz** should now display the saved map from the SLAM stage.
   - View **RViz** and **Gazebo** side by side.
   - Suggested Single Monitor Layout with **2D Pose Estimate**:

       ![Nav Setup Example](Images/Nav_Setup_Example.png)
3. In **RViz** use the **2D Pose Estimate** tool to set the robot's initial pose:
   - Click the **2D Pose Estimate** tool in the top tool bar.
   - Click and drag on the map to indicate the robot’s approximate position and heading (can reference **Gazebo** for rough initial pose).
4. Once localization is stable, use the **Nav2 Goal** tool to send navigation goals:
   - Click the **Nav2 Goal** button in the top toolbar.
   - Click and drag on the desired destination on the map to define the goal position and orientation.
   - The robot will plan a path (displayed as a colored line) and begin moving toward that goal.
   - This can be repeated to send additional goals.
5. You can monitor progress with **Gazebo** and **RViz**.
   - **Gazebo** shows the robot "physically" moving around the simulated world.
   - **RVIZ** shows the planned path, current postion, local costmap, and goal status updates in real time.
6. When finished, return to **[0] guide** terminal and enter `q` to quit the session.  
   This stops all processes and returns you to the container shell.

## Stage 3 — Automated Navigation Survey

After manually tasking your in Nav2, you can now see how you can automate that process with Python! 

### Launch Nav2 + Survey
Inside the same container session:
```bash
bash /root/scripts/survey.sh
```
This starts a tmux session that launches:
- Gazebo simulation
- Nav2 + RViz
- Python survey script 

### Tab Layout (Shown at Bottom of Terminal)

| Tab | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| [0] | **guide** | Instructions + quit control (`q`) |
| [1] | **gazebo** | Gazebo launch|
| [2] | **nav2** | Nav2 + RViz launch |
| [3] | **survey** | Run survey script |

### Navigating Between Tabs

Use the **Alt + number** shortcuts:
- **Alt + 0** → guide  
- **Alt + 1** → gazebo  
- **Alt + 2** → nav2  
- **Alt + 3** → survey

### Operating Nav2 Survey

1. Start in **[0] guide** to review instructions.
2. Wait for **Gazebo** and **RViz** to pop-up.  
   - **RViz** should now display the saved map from the SLAM stage.
   - View **RViz** and **Gazebo** side by side (like in Stage 2)
   - *If **Gazebo** is hung up, just wait, since we are now using a larger map, can take longer to boot up.*
3. You can monitor **[3] survey** terminal for tasking updates, however the survey should start automatically for you to watch!
   - **Gazebo** shows the robot "physically" moving around the simulated world.
   - **RVIZ** shows the planned path, current postion, local costmap, and goal status updates in real time.
4. When finished, return to **[0] guide** terminal and enter `q` to quit the session.  
   This stops all processes and returns you to the container shell.
5. To exit the container:
   ```
   exit
   ```

## Summary

This workflow keeps all operations within a single container session.  
You build once, enter once, and use tmux automation to transition seamlessly between SLAM and Navigation without managing multiple terminals.  
Mapping, saving, localization, navigation, and a automatic survey demo are all handled through structured tmux windows with simple keyboard shortcuts.
